# PTO Finance

A personal application for keeping track of transactions on the go.

Capabilities (to be updated):

- Import a set of accounts (these should be exported from a valid GnuCash instance; `File > Export > Export Account Tree to CSV...`)
- Create transactions a GnuCash-compatible, double-bookkeeping fashion
- Export said transactions for import into a standalone GnuCash instance (`File > Import > Import Transactions from CSV...`). Use the "GnuCash Export Format".
- Set favorite debit and credit accounts for pre-populating transaction fields.
